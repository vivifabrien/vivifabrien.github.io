## Bio

Hello, my name is Vivien Fabry and I am a Ph.D. candidate and research associate in the political and social science faculty at the Free University in Berlin. I earned my M.Sc. in Social Sciences from the University of Amsterdam, laying the groundwork for my academic journey. My research focuses on computational methods, political behavior and disability politics.
